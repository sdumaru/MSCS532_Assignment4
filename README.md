# HEAP DATA STRUCTURES AND PRIORITY QUEUE: IMPLEMENTATION, ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
This repository explores the implementation of heap data structures, including Heapsort and priority queues. The aim is to analyze the performance of Heapsort and to design a priority queue using a min-heap for task scheduling.

## Files
- 'heap_sort.py' : Python implementation of Heapsort using a max-heap.
- 'Assignment4_Report.pdf' : Detailed report about the implementation, analysis, comparisons, and applications of heap data structures.
-  'priority_queue.py' : Python implementation of a priority queue using a min-heap.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository using the command: git clone https://github.com/sdumaru/MSCS532_Assignment4.git
2. Make sure python is already installed in your system, otherwise download and install python.
3. Navigate to the repository directory: cd MSCS532_Assignment4
4. Run the code using the command: python .\heap_sort.py or python .\priority_queue.py

## SUMMARY
This assignment demonstrates the efficiency of heap data structures for sorting and priority management. Both heapsort using max-heap and priority queue using min-heap were successfully implemented and analyzed for their performance and applications.
